Installing the BlitzMail server (AIX 3.2.5 RS/6000)
===================================================

Setting up BlitzMail on a new system involves installing the server binaries,
setting up the BlitzMail configuration file, and making the appropriate
changes to system boot scripts to start up the Blitz server automatically.
Most of these steps need to be done as root.

1. Create a directory to hold the BlitzMail distribution files, cd to it, and
unpack the distribution via 'zcat blitz.tar.Z | tar xvf -'.

2. Type "make install" to install the BlitzMail binaries and utility scripts.
If you're installing on a new system (as opposed to updating an existing
installation), also do a "make install-config" to copy the sample config file
into /usr/local/lib/blitz.

3. Create one or more directories to hold BlitzMail mailboxes (one directory
for each disk partition you use for mailboxes).  If your host is named "fred",
you might use "/fred1" for the first mailbox directory, "/fred2" for the
second, and so forth; or use whatever naming convention you prefer.  The
mailbox directory doesn't have to be on a filesystem all its own; if you have
only 1 disk you can just put it in the root or /usr filesystem.

4. Edit the Blitz configuration file (/usr/local/lib/blitz/blitzconfig)
filling in the appropriate host, directory, and file names for your site.
See the "BlitzManage" document for descriptions of all the configuration file
commands.

5. Add /etc/services services definitions for Blitz's well-known tcp and udp ports.

poppassd        106/tcp         ppassd epass    # Dorner POP passwd changer
pop3            110/tcp
dnd             902/tcp                         # Dartmouth Name Directory
dndctl          903/tcp                         # DND console
blitzmail       2151/tcp                        # Blitzmail server
blitzctl        2153/tcp                        # Blitzmail server console
blitzctl        2153/udp                        # Blitz server status
dartnotify      2152/tcp                        # Notification server (send)
dartnotify-me   2154/udp                        # Notification server (recv)

6. Run /usr/local/lib/blitz/computemessid to initialize the "messid" file.
This program will read the blitzconfig file (to determine what mailbox
filesystems exist), then search all mailboxes to determine the next available
message id. Since you're starting from a clean disk, messageids will begin at
101. (NOTE: the DND server must be installed & running before running
"computemessid").

7. If desired, set up the greeting message new users will receive the first
time they sign on.  A sample greeting message ("Welcome.txt") is included in
this distribution.  Edit the greeting text as appropriate for your site.
Since the message text is in Mac format, each paragraph of the text is one
long line; use an editor (like Emacs) that doesn't mind this.  Note
also that it's possible to include Mac special chars in the text, although
they display oddly on the screen.

You should be sure to change the Message-id: and From: lines to use the
appropriate host names; you'll probably want to change the date too.  Don't
remove any of the header lines, though; they're necessary.

When you're done editing the message, use the "makemess" utility to convert
the text into a BlitzMail-format message; place the results in the file named
in the INITIALMESS line of blitzconfig.  For example:

    /usr/local/lib/blitz/makemess <Welcome.txt >/fred1/Welcome

8. Verify that you have a valid /usr/adm directory.  Normally, this is a symbolic link to /var/adm.  Type "make install-scripts" to install daily, weekly and monthly
Blitz cleanup scripts in /usr/adm.

Add the following lines to the root crontab:

#
# daily, weekly, monthly blitz cleanup
#
0 0 * * *  /bin/sh /usr/adm/blitzdaily >/usr/adm/blitzdaily.log 2>&1
10 0 * * 6 /bin/sh /usr/adm/blitzweekly >/usr/adm/blitzweekly.log 2>&1
20 0 1 * * /bin/sh /usr/adm/blitzmonthly >/usr/adm/blitzmonthly.log 2>&1

9. Edit /etc/rc.tcpip to not run the sendmail daemon as an SMTP server
(the BlitzMail server uses the SMTP port, so sendmail can't have it).
The sendmail daemon will still check the queue for outgoing messages
(in case a Unix user sends mail from the server machine).

Locate the line that looks like:

    start /usr/lib/sendmail "$src_running" "-bd -q$(qpi}"

and change it to:

   /usr/lib/sendmail -q15m -om &

(i.e., remove the '-bd' option.  Doing this means you can't use the resource manager startsrc - it demands that -bd be used!)

10. Add the BlitzMail and DND psuedo-hosts to the name server for your local
domain.  The psuedo-hosts do not have IP addresses, just MX records pointing
to the BlitzMail server machine(s).  For example, if your DND psuedo-host is
"directory", your BlitzMail psuedo-host is "blitz", and you have two BlitzMail
servers "fred" and "ethel", add records:


directory       MX      10      fred
directory       MX      10      ethel
blitz       	MX      10      fred
blitz       	MX      10      ethel

11. The Blitz server processes log errors using syslog(3), with a facility
code of LOG_LOCAL1.  The default syslog configuration will send these
errors to the console and to /usr/adm/messages.  If you wish to have a
distinct log file (e.g., /usr/adm/blitz-debug) for just BlitzMail, add the
following line to /etc/syslog.conf:

local1.debug                                    /usr/adm/blitz-debug

12. If desired, create a /cores directory so all BlitzMail
core dumps go to a well-known place.  The BlitzMail master server checks the
space remaining on the file system containing /cores; it limits core dump size
so a dump won't consume more than half the remaining free disk space.

13. Check the maxusers setting.  You can do this using SMIT.

14. Reboot the machine; the BlitzMail server will start up automatically.

15. The first thing you should do after BlitzMail is up and running is create
a "postmaster" mailing list.  

First, connect to the BlitzMail server control port.  If your server machine
is  "fred", you'd do "telnet fred blitzctl".  Log in with your DND name and
password (you must have BLITZPRIV permission on your DND account to use the
BlitzMail control connection).  Use the "ledit" command to create a list
called "postmaster", giving everyone permission to read and send to the list,
but reserving write permission:

Blitzctl fred> ledit postmaster
Creating new list 'postmaster'
Owner [Blitzmail] 
Group [Blitzmail] 
Owner accesses rws
Group accesses rs
World accesses rs

Permissions for list 'postmaster' will be:
Owner:   BlitzMail
Group:   BlitzMail
Access:  (Owner: RWS; Group: RS; World: RS)
Is this correct? [Y or N] y
List created.

Users with BLITZPRIV permission always have access to all lists.  Sign on
to the BlitzMail application, click on the "Address Book" icon, and choose
"Group Lists".  Open the "postmaster" list and enter the name(s) of the
people who should receive BlitzMail questions and trouble reports at your
site.


About Hostnames
===============

There are a number of special hostnames involved in putting together a
BlitzMail system.  First, there is the BlitzMail psuedo-host name (defined
by the HOSTNAME command in blitzconfig).  A given BlitzMail system may 
contain multiple BlitzMail servers, but the existence of the multiple 
servers is hidden from the average user; individual server names never 
appear in mail addresses.  Instead, the Blitz psuedo-host name (we suggest
you use "blitz") refers to all the servers collectively.
An address of <user>@<blitzhost> directs the message to that user's 
BlitzMail mailbox.  The BlitzMail servers automatically take care of 
getting the message to the correct server; neither the sender nor the
recipient need know which server has the mailbox.

The other psuedo-hostname is DNDHOST.  Sending to <user>@<dndhost> directs
the message to that user's preferred mail address (based on the MAILADDR 
field of their DND entry). If the user's preferred address is BlitzMail,
their MAILADDR will be set to <user>@<blitzhost>, and the message will 
go to their BlitzMail box.  The difference between <user>@<blitzhost> 
and <user>@<dndhost> is that the former always goes to the BlitzMail
account, while the latter goes to whatever the user has chosen as their
preferred address.  

It's important to understand that DNDHOST is not necessarily the same 
as the actual hostname of the machine that runs the DND server; it's a
logical host name that senders use to direct mail to a given user's 
preferred mailbox.  The BlitzMail server knows to do this mail 
redirection when it sees a message addressed to <user>@<dndhost>.
You can set up DNDHOST as a psuedo-host with no IP address, just MX 
record(s) pointing to the BlitzMail server(s).  For example, if DNDHOST is
"directory", the BlitzMail server might redirect a message for
"Fred.Flintstone@directory.foobar.edu" to Fred's BlitzMail account if he uses
BlitzMail or "fredf@fredvax.foobar.edu" if he doesn't.

If the DND is going to serve as the central mail redirecting authority
for the entire site, DNDHOST can be simply the domain name of the
institution (foobar.edu); that means that to send mail to anyone at Foobar
you just mail to full_name@foobar.edu. Again, you would do this by making
the MX for "foobar.edu" point to the BlitzMail server(s).

The DNDRESOLVER config command controls how the Blitz server handles
<user>@<dndhost> messages when <user> doesn't resolve uniquely in the DND.
If DNDRESOLVER is ON, Blitz is the final authority and will bounce any
messages that don't resolve. If DNDRESOLVER is OFF, they will instead be
forwarded to <dndhost>; this is appropriate only if <dndhost> is going to
do something with the message other than send it right back to Blitz!
