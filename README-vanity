Configuring BlitzMail for "Vanity" domains
==========================================

The vanity domain feature lets one BlitzMail system masquerade as several
independent domains. This is accomplished by configuring the BlitzMail server
to recognize the vanity domain name(s) as aliases for the primary DND
domain name, so it will accept messages for <user>@<vanity> as well as
<user>@<dndhost>.

On outgoing messages, the BlitzMail server will use the EMAIL field of the
sender's DND entry to generate the From: line, thus using the correct vanity
domain for that particular user. The MAILFROM field of the DND entry holds
the vanity domain name (or is null, for the default domain). Whenever the
NAME or MAILFROM field changes, the DND server automatically recomputes the
EMAIL field as <name>@<mailfrom>.

To add a vanity domain name to your system, the name must be configured in
the dndconfig and blitzconfig files, as well as in the DNS database.

For example, to add "vanity.com" as a vanity domain for your system:

0) Make sure your DND database includes the MAILFROM field.

1) In dndconfig, add the line:

	MAILFROM vanity.com

This instructs the DND server to accept "vanity.com" as a legal value
for the MAILFROM field. Once you've done this, you can then go through and
change the MAILFROM field of everyone that wants to be in the vanity domain.

2) In blitzconfig, add the line:

	DNDHOST vanity.com

Note that this should come *after* your existing DNDHOST configuration line,
since you're adding an alias, not changing the current one. This causes the
BlitzMail server to recognize mail for <user>@vanity.com as "local".

3) In DNS, add an MX record for "vanity.com" pointing to your Blitz server
host(s), so the rest of the world will know to route "vanity.com" mail to
BlitzMail.
