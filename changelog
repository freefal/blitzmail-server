Prancer is now running a beta version of the 2.0 blitz server. This is 
a major new release of the server, incorporating all the new filing 
features and numerous (minor) changes to make the code compile on 
the alpha.

A few minor bug fixes have also been added since version 1.22:

¥ De-binhexing no longer trashes the finder info of files with very 
long names

¥ personal lists are no longer checked when trying to resolve the 
members of a public mailing list (public lists should be context-
insensitive)

¥ wait 30 seconds before retrying dnd hostname lookup (so you don't 
go into a hard loop if dartvax&coos are both down)

¥ control connection command to add mailing lists now checks for 
disconnects each step of the way

¥ still more kinds of automatic messages are recognized as such (and 
don't generate a return receipt)


The portability changes are extremely pervasive (the diff runs to 
over 90 pages), so be on the lookout for any sort of unusual behavior 
from prancer.

This is also your chance to start trying out the 2.0 client Jim sent out 
earlier (you can't use it with the old server). One warning: if for any 
reason we have to revert prancer to the old software, any folders 
you create will vanish and everything will end up back in the InBox.

We've been running version 2.2 of the Blitz server on all reindeer for 
the past 2 weeks or so. For the record, here's the log of changes since 
version 2.0.

>> signon timeout 1 minute instead of 2
>> increase DND_MAXCONN to 10
>> don't accept upload larger than 80% of free tmp space
>> single-folder FLIS
>> startup: log both recoverable (DND down) and unrecoverable (bad 
name) errors
>> startup: don't spin when DND down
>> cty: more information in uid/user commands
>> folder length calculation; FLIS shows length
>> smtp: clean up temp files after client disconnect
>> smtp: fix bug in mailbox xfer - initialize holes in folder seq. to -1

Subject: SMTP timeouts
Date: Fri, Sep 24, 1993 4:39 AM

Several of the Blitz servers, prancer in particular, have been having 
problems with too many open files recently.

Part of the problem appears to be incoming SMTP connections from 
dartvax -- when dartvax crashes or has to be rebooted in the middle 
of the day, the blitz servers can end up with a bunch of lingering 
SMTP connections (I counted 40 on prancer yesterday).

To prevent too many resources from being devoted to non-functional 
SMTP connections, I've introduced a couple of protections into the 
Blitz server. First, it now has an upper limit on how many 
simultaneous SMTP connections it will accept (configurable; default = 
20). Also, there's now an idle timeout on all incoming and outgoing 
SMTP connections (default value = 20 minutes). The timer is reset 
whenever a command or an buffer of data is sent/received; its 
purpose is to clear things out if the other end of the connection dies 
or hangs unexpectedly. The value of 20 minutes is quite conservative 
(if nothing has happened for that long, it seems very unlikely the 
connection is still viable). The *minimum* SMTP timer values 
specified in the Host Requirements RFC range from 5 to 10 minutes.

The new server software (2.2.1.1) is running only on prancer so far; 
if no problems arise I will install it on the other machines.

In case you're interested, here's the complete list of changes in the
version I just checked Friday. I'm going to continue to play around 
with buffered/unbuffered io, but I thought I'd make an official 
version first.

I guess this qualifies as the Beta of the Alpha server -- the feature 
list is
now complete (including a new BlitzWatch protocol), and at this 
instant there
are no known bugs.

Subject: dancer updated
To: blitzmail-team@Mac

Dancer is now running version 2.9 of the Blitz server.

This fixes the bug that caused connections beyond the first 64 to be 
immune from timeouts. It also uses a different strategy for checking 
for pending input (one select() per connection, instead of a master 
thread to check all connections) that's more cpu-friendly on the 
Alpha. Unfortunately, this doesn't work on the NeXTs, so there are 
two versions of the code conditionally compiled.

Here's the complete list of changes since version 2.6 (11/1/93):

>> fix bug in ForwardTo "me"
>> don't flush before beginning download (send length & data in same 
buffer)
>> UPDATELISTS console command
>> watch for long addresses in exportmess
>> initialize dnd semaphores before use
>> finfocopy uses normal buffering - trade an extra strcpy for fewer 
packets
>> catch long addresses in message headers
>> validate fsname when reading input queue; re-resolve if bogus
>> in m_smtpdisconnect mode, avoid sending QUIT on dead 
connection
>> on xfer, ignore bogus prefs (rather than killing the transfer)
>> put correct # in "duplicate summary" log message
>> do a t_dndclosepool() when a dead DND connection is detected
>> keep log file open for efficiency
>> fix memory leak if DUP'd user signs on
>> add abortsig() routine (to get clean dump on OSF/1)
>> return error if t_fflush interrupted by urgent/disconnect
>> t_fwrite copies data in bulk, and returns length
>> allocate only space needed for config strings
>> SMTPDISCLAIMER command
>> do isascii() before islower() - fixes bug in special chars in list 
names
>> check for urgent data (break) on cty connection
>> increase SUMMBUCK_LEN from 1500 to 2000 (waste less of 2048-
byte malloc)
>> fix memory leak in OSF version (call pthread_cond_destroy)
>> retry instead of abort on blitz-smtp protocol error
>> fix bug in check for non-peer blitzformat message
>> fix bug in cleanup from failed transfer
>> fix bug in t_fread that returned error as result of old t_errno value 
(bug caused connections to be permanently bad after an ethernet 
jam)
>> specific console message for lost connection on outgoing SMTP
>> summary info now includes recipient name
>> new shutdownpoll thread to watch for shutdown signal (instead of 
t_select)
>> don't let connection timeout value go negative

To: blitzmail-team@Mac

Dancer & Prancer are now running a new version of the blitz server. This is
basically a maintenance release, with lots of trivia like updated copyright
information & simplified makefile configuration in preparation for
packaging things up for anonymous ftp.

The only substantive changes are:

* blitzq.c: close directory when done reading it

* Set FIONBIO option (non-blocking io) on connections to ensure that a
write won't block indefinitely because of network flow control. This fixes
an Alpha-specific problem - select() can say "it's ok to write", but maybe
it can only take 512 bytes when you want to write 1k. Avoiding blocking
makes sure a hung connection doesn't cause the user's mailbox to become
locked indefinitely.

* The t_io code now supports telnet escape sequence processing (on
connections that enable it); merging in the t_io code from the DND server.
This makes breaks work a little better on the blitzctl connection.

* The nbp server now processes echo packets. This makes the blitz servers visible
to a MacPing on their CAP network, and will help out the file server code.

If no problems are reported, the new version will be installed on the
remaining servers this weekend.

Subject: blitzserv 2.12 available
Date: Wed, Sep 28, 1994 11:18 PM

Version 2.12 of the Blitz server is now available in the usual place 
(ftp://ftp.dartmouth.edu//pub/mac/BlitzMail/Export).

There aren't a lot of significant changes since the 2.11 beta versions that 
have been out for a while. One thing that may be of interest is that the 
blitzctl  "uid" and "user" commands now work even if your DND doesn't have 
a DEPTCLASS field.  Also, there's more information in the "stolog" file, and
inter-server mailbox transfers automatically remove the box from the old
server now.

The Alpha binaries are now compiled under OSF/1 version 2.1. They're statically
linked, which makes them larger, but allows binaries compiled under 2.1 to run
on OSF/1 version 1.3 (which doesn't work if you try to use shared libraries). 
The binaries have been tested on both 1.3 and 2.1 systems (but not under 3.0);
let me know if you encounter trouble in this area.

Before upgrading, we recommend you make backup copies of the previous version, 
just in case.

A more detailed list of changes follows.

Changes since blitzserv2.10:

>> fix bug in handling <listname>-request special addresses

>> use readdir instead of obsolete "getdirentries" when reading directory

>> messages in Sent Msgs is now included in total when decided whether to
issue "boxpig" warning

>> server will no longer allow standard folders to be renamed

>> check for existence of DEPTCLASS field before trying to read it

>> when moving box to different server ("xfer" blitzctl command) or cleaning 
out invalid boxes ("cleanout"), do box rm and cp's interally (instead of using 
fork/exec to run rm or cp). This is a major efficiency gain, since forking a 
multi-threaded program is extremely expensive (and has a nasty tendency to drive 
OS bugs). Inter-server transfers now automatically remove the box from the old
server once the transfer finishes.

>> The "xfer" control connection command can now be interrupted by control-C


>> include disk name & mess count in stolog file

>> generate correct BlitzWatch numbers under OSF/1 2.x, where there's now a new 
CP_WAIT CPU state

>> an inter-server transfer now clears the Expired<n> prefs (they're invalid, 
since the new server has different message numbers)

>> lock individual mailbox instead of global mbox_sem when recording blitzinfo 
in DND

>> free in-memory copies of box information (summaries, mailing lists) based 
on idle count, not simple timer.

>> log if mbox_sem locked for more than 5 seconds

[ The previous 3 changes all help diagnose/avoid a performance problem that can
occur on a server with too little memory. The global mbox_sem is locked while
the server makes a pass through the mailbox list freeing up cached information
that hasn't been used recently; while it's locked essentially all user actions
are put on hold. The lock is held for a negligible amount of time (milliseconds
at most) *unless* pathological virtual memory behavior occurs and the server
takes a zillion page faults. The new code reduces thrashing with a better 
strategy for freeing cached mailbox data, and also notices when it incurs a
delay of 5 seconds or more. If you see messages like "mbox_sem locked for <n>
seconds" in your log file, you need more memory (or fewer users)! ]


Changes in version 2.12 of 'master':

>> allow args on subcommands
>> -d option
>> print more information (subjob name) on console
>> handle bavail units difference between OSF & NeXT
>> disassociate() *before* starting threads
>> don't re-launch children once KILL signal received

Version 2.13 of the Blitz server is now available in:

	ftp://ftp.dartmouth.edu//pub/mac/BlitzMail/Export/

The following changes have been made since the last release:

* The UID and USER control commands now work at sites that don't have a
DEPTCLASS field in their DND [ this time for sure... ]

* A new MESSMAXLEN config command allows you to limit the max message size
users can send.

* The word-wrap margin when sending to non-blitz recipients is now 80, instead
of 78.

* The mbox_sem lock is now finer-grained (each hash table row is locked
independently). This should improve performance problems resulting from
contention for this lock.

A new release (2.14) of the Blitz server is available for FTP in the regular
place:

ftp://ftp.dartmouth.edu/pub/mac/BlitzMail/Export/

As usual, Dec and NeXT binaries are provided, as well as sources.


There's one very exciting new feature in this version -- the Blitz server now
supports POP3 clients! Thanks to some diligent effort by Jim Matthews hacking
this feature into the server, you can now read BlitzMail using Eudora (or any
other POP mailer).

This means access to Blitz from DOS, Windows, Unix, and any other system that
has a POP mail client -- the elusive Windows BlitzMail is finally here (in a
backhanded sort of way).

POP support is optional; to enable it make sure the following entries are
present in the /etc/services file:

poppassd        106/tcp         ppassd epass    # Dorner POP passwd changer
pop3            110/tcp

One warning: Blitz and Eudora have fundamentally different approaches to
storing mail: Blitz keeps mail on the server, while Eudora likes to store it on
your local hard disk. If you switch back and forth between Blitz and Eudora
clients, there's potential for confusion (Eudora can't see Blitz folders and
vice-versa). One tip: turn on the "leave mail on server" preference in Eudora,
to keep Eudora from deleting everything from the server (and leaving it only on
your local disk).


Technical details: POP clients are handled much like Blitz clients, so you
can't sign on via both protocols at the same time, and automatic timeouts apply
equally to both (but probably aren't very necessary for POP clients).  The POP
STAT command has the side effect of clearing the new mail bit (like the Blitz
WARN command).  The POP RETR command marks a message as read (like the Blitz
TEXT command). The RETR command will download any Blitz enclosures as BinHex;
clients (like Eudora) that support BinHex will do the right thing. The POP DELE
command moves messages to the Trash folder, subject to that folder's expiration
interval (just like the old Blitz DELE command). There's a new config command
(DFTTRASHEXPIRE) that lets you specify a default expiration for the trash. If
you expect to have some POP-only users, it would be wise to set an appropriate
trash expiration, since POP deletes things but never empties the trash.

Known bugs: MIME messages with BinHex enclosures and lines that start
"Content-Type: application/mac-binhex40" but *aren't* MIME body part headers
may have the BinHex in the wrong place.

Extra feature: You can change your password (i.e. your DND password) from
Eudora and some other POP clients.

Version 2.15 of the Blitz server is available for FTP in the regular place:

ftp://ftp.dartmouth.edu/pub/mac/BlitzMail/Export/

There are no major changes since version 2.14; except that version 2.15 now
runs under AIX 3.2 (IBM-ish Unix). Thanks to the Dartmouth Mafia at Apple
(Michael McDaniel, Jamie Osborne, and Nick Brosnahan) for undertaking the work
of porting the code to AIX!

Because AIX isn't one of our principal hardware platforms, Dartmouth will not
distribute AIX binaries -- if you'd like to run the Blitz server on an AIX
machine, you have to get the sources and compile it yourself.

A new release of the DND with support for AIX and for Oracle version 7 will be
forthcoming "soon".

One note: the inter-process communication mechanism used between notifyd and
nbpd has changed since version 2.14; be sure to upgrade all the binaries
(blitzserv, notifyd, and nbpd) at once.
